Welcome to a tour of computational biology!

This repository is provided in lieu of a textbook. 

-------------------------------
"Why use this instead of a textbook?"

I don't have a computational biology textbook that I particularly like. I think it's more useful to hear the theory in the style of a math lecture and then see a guerrilla implementation in the style of a code repository, with illustrative data right next to it. Biological concepts are strewn throughout the lectures as they come up.

When I took a computational biology course, I barely touched the textbook. I had very capable professors, and so I mostly just listened to them or talked to my fellow students about ideas. 

-------------------------------
"Where can I read about the ideas discussed in the lecture and implemented in this repository?"

References are provided in the relevant folders of this repository, either as latex write-ups, papers, or website printouts where open access is available, or as citations where open access is unavailable. 

-------------------------------
"What software packages do I need to download to run the examples here?"

Python code is version python3. It uses several packages, including numpy, pylab/matplotlib, networkx, and biopython. 

Clustal Omega is used as a standalone package. 

g++ (or clang++) is used for C++ code. 

-------------------------------
"Can I use the ideas and code here to make money?"

I don't know... Can you?

-------------------------------
"*May* I use the ideas and code here to make money?"

Sure. The license (see file license.txt) is Creative Commons Attribution. You can keep your money, just mention that you got some code from me (Oliver Serang) and acknowledge the authors of the methods described.

"Are you wearing your mask as you type this? You can't be too careful these days..."

I wear my mask soooo much. Mostly because it hides my horrific scar. Long story short, I had a bad fall playing The Floor is Gluten in Brooklyn when this dog walker happened by, you know, aggressively power-walking... You know what, it isn't important. But I'll get that dog walker. I am a survivor and revenge is a dish best served gluten free.

"Hmm... Are you sure your qualified for this?"

First of all [flicks bangs out of eyes] it's *you're* not your. Second of all, do you think JFK's "I have a dream" speech or Martin Luther King's "Let's go to the moon" speech were prepared in advance? They just spoke from the heart, alright? 

See, that joke was from Jen Kirkman. That's how attribution works. According to the theory of the internet, her bank account just got an attribution deposit for being one more funny.
